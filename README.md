In the study of global health, the measure of life expectancy is one of the most important indicators of the
overall health and wellness of the world. In such research, it is important to identify potential factors that
could contribute to greater longevity. To this end, this report will analyze the extent to which socioeconomic
factors such as development status, GDP, population, alcohol consumption, and education have an effect
on life expectancy to hopefully elucidate a relationship that can be used to identify methods to prolong life
expectancy around the world.
