In the study of global health, the measure of life expectancy is one of the most important indicators of the overall health and wellness of the world. In such research, it is important to identify potential factors thatcould contribute to greater longevity. To this end, this report will analyze the extent to which socioeconomic factors such as development status, GDP, population, alcohol consumption, and education have an effect on life expectancy to hopefully elucidate a relationship that can be used to identify methods to prolong life expectancy around the world.

[An article published in the J-Stage Journal of Epidemiology](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jea/24/2/24_JE20130059/_article) considered mean years of schooling and gross national income per capita for 91 countries as potential contributors to life expectancy. The results suggested that these factors were correlated to life expectancy, and thus education should be improved in order to increase the overall duration of life. Our analysis will similarly examine potential socioeconomic factors to life expectancy, using data reported in 2019.

## Methods
The goal of this analysis is to develop a model that can explain the relationship between life expectancy
and several socioeconomic factors. This process will involve a series of statistical methods regarding variable
selection, model validation, and assessing potential violations through model diagnostics.
